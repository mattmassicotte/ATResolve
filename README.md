# ATResolve
AT Protocol PLC/DID/Whatever Resolver

I just want to resolve a handle to a DID and PDS. There's more to do, but this is a start. [This](https://github.com/mackuba/didkit/blob/master/lib/didkit/resolver.rb) could be a good reference.

## Integration

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mattmassicotte/ATResolve", branch: "main")
]
```

## Usage

```swift
import ATResolve

let resolver = ATResolver()

let data = try await resolver.resolveHandle("massicotte.org")

print(data.did)
print(data.serviceEndpoint)
```

## Contributing and Collaboration

I would love to hear from you! Issues or pull requests work great. Both a [Matrix space][matrix] and [Discord][discord] are available for live help, but I have a strong bias towards answering in the form of documentation. You can also find me on [the web](https://www.massicotte.org).

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by the [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
